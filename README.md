# Traffic Sign Classifier
 In this project, I have trained deep learning models known as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify 43 traffic sign images.
 
 
 # In this Project we will go through the following tasks:
  1. Import libraries and datasets
  2. Images visualization
  3. Convert images to gray-scale and perform normalization
  4. Build deep learning model
  5. Compile and train deep learning model
  6. Assess trained model performance
